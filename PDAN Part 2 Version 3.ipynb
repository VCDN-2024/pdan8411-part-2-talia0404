    "#### **Reference to dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle. 2024. Heart Disease Dataset. [Online] Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/heart-disease-dataset [Accessed: 20 May 2024]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataset description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kaggle, 2024, this heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. These datasets were collected and were combined at a single place to help further along research on CAD (Coronary artery disease)-related machine learning and data mining algorithms. It is also hoped to help advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment(Kaggle, 2024). \n",
    "This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the act of classifying objects into sub-categories based on their features or attributes (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). Classification falls under supervised machine learning where the model attempts to predict the right label of the input data. The training data is used to train the model and then the model is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data. The main goal for classification is to build a model that can allocate labels or categories to new observations based on its features (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). \n",
    "For example, the dataset that is being used contains labeled features of factors relating to CAD and a classification model can use this data to make diagnosis for CAD easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Classification: \n",
    "The target variable has only two possible classes or labels (e.g.: spam vs. non-spam email). The objective is to classify the data into one of the two classes(Datacamp, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-class Classification: \n",
    "The target variable has more than two classes (e.g., classifying images of handwritten digits into one of 10 classes). The objective is to classify the data into one of the multiple classes (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Data: Classification algorithms take input data where each feature describes a particular aspect of the data (Datacamp, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Target Labels: Each data point in the training set is associated with a target label or class (Datacamp, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Data: A labeled dataset is used to train the classification model. It consists of input data points along with their corresponding target labels. The model learns patterns and relationships in the training data to make predictions on unseen data (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Building: Classification algorithms build a model that can predict the class label of new data based on the patterns the model learned from the training data (Datacamp, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation: After the model is trained, it's evaluated using a different dataset which is the test set. The performance of the model is assessed based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction: After evaluation, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new and unseen data (Datacamp, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why the chosen dataset is appropriate for analysis with classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided includes labeled features related to CAD (Kaggle, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "The features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age\n",
    "Sex\n",
    "Chest pain type\n",
    "Resting blood pressure\n",
    "Cholesterol level\n",
    "Fasting blood sugar\n",
    "Resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "Maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "Exercise-induced angina\n",
    "ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak)\n",
    "Slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "Target (the presence or absence of CAD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data point represents a patient and includes both the features, input data, and the target label,diagnosis of CAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Data: \n",
    "The dataset includes various features that describe each patient's health parameters. These features serve as the input data for the classification algorithm. According to Datacamp (2022), classification algorithms require input data where each feature describes a particular aspect of the data, making this dataset suitable for such analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Labels: \n",
    "The target variable in the dataset is the diagnosis of CAD, which is a binary classification problem (presence or absence of CAD). This aligns with the definition of binary classification, where the target variable has only two possible classes (GeeksforGeeks, 2024; Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Data: \n",
    "The dataset is labeled, meaning each patient record includes a target label indicating the presence or absence of CAD. This labeled dataset can be used to train the classification model, allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions on unseen data (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Building: \n",
    "Classification algorithms can use the features provided to build a model that predicts the CAD diagnosis based on the patterns learned from the training data. The diverse and relevant features in the dataset (age, sex, cholesterol levels, ...) are suitable for creating a predictive model (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: \n",
    "The dataset can be split into training and test sets. The model can be trained on the training set and then evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This evaluation process is critical to assess the model's performance and its ability to generalize to new data (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: Once evaluated and fine-tuned, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new and unseen patient data. This application aligns with the goal of classification, which is to allocate labels or categories to new observations based on their features (GeeksforGeeks, 2024; Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    " The features included in the dataset are medically relevant and commonly used indicators of heart health and CAD risk. Features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are critical in diagnosing CAD (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Classification Task: \n",
    "The diagnosis of CAD (presence or absence) fits into a binary classification framework. This goes perfectly with the classification types discussed, making the dataset suitable for algorithms designed for binary classification tasks (Datacamp, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sufficient Data for Training: \n",
    "The dataset includes 1190 entries, which provides a substantial amount of data to train a robust classification model. This volume of data allows for meaningful training and evaluation, reducing the risk of overfitting and ensuring the model can generalise well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced Class Distribution: \n",
    "While not explicitly stated, if the dataset has a balanced distribution of positive and negative cases of CAD, it would be highly beneficial for training a balanced model. Even if there is some imbalance, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using different evaluation metrics can help address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world Applicability: \n",
    "The use of real patient data with medically relevant features ensures that the model built from this dataset can be practically applied in clinical settings to aid in the diagnosis of CAD, which could potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.\n",
