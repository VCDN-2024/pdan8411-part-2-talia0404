    "According to Kaggle, 2024, this heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. These datasets were collected and were combined at a single place to help further along research on CAD (Coronary artery disease)-related machine learning and data mining algorithms. It is also hoped to help advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment(Kaggle, 2024). \n",
